# CS-ParallelComputing
Coursework projects for Parallel Computing course by N. Wolovick at UNC

## Directories

This coursework repository is structured in the following manner (more information on each folder's readme):

- tiny\_mc/: in this folder you can find the main project I worked on throughout the course.
- reports: in this folder you will find the reports on the coursework in `.tex` (and maybe `.pdf` if it's light enough) format.
- [TODO]/: this is my final project for the course.
